## An Open Chess Tournament

This is more than a tournament — it’s a celebration of every curious mind.
Now step into the game. Move your <!-- BEGIN TURN --><!-- END TURN --> piece.

<!-- BEGIN CHESS BOARD -->
<!-- END CHESS BOARD -->

**Your move awaits. Choose your piece from the table below.**
<!-- BEGIN MOVES LIST -->
<!-- END MOVES LIST -->

Delight in the play, then let a friend carry the next move forward.

### How it works

With a single click, your move travels through code — a GitHub Action springs to life, guiding a Python script that moves the piece, rewrites this README, and seals it all in a new commit.

### Credit
